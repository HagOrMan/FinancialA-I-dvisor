# FinancialA-I-dvisor
A financial advisor that will look at your current financial situation and provide an expert opinion supported by machine learning.

Some features that we hope to add are matching the user's data with a real financial advisor to verify that the data is good and if it should be included in our database. This database allows us to check where each user stands compared to the average spender for their income level and provide realistic financial advice to them.
We also hope to add a connection with Power BI or another data visualization tool to provide in the email to the user, allowing them to see an easy to understand visual report of their finances and how they could improve. 
Finally, we need better recommendations for the users on investments, allowing them to secure a good future by putting their money towards something that they feel comfortable with and which will give them good returns.
